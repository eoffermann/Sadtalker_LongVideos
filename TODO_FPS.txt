This project was such a mess for FPS reasons. I needed to switch it to 30fps but it should
be configurable instead. It'll just take some work to feed the FPS through everything.

Here are the locations where FPS is specified:

FILE                                        LINES
=======================================     ==========
src/generate_batch.py                       54, 61, 65
src/facerender/animate.py                   197, 200
src/facerender/modules/make_animation.py    177
src/utils/hparams.py                        66, 135
src/utils/preprocess.py                     77

Allowing fps to be specified as a parameter is pretty damn important.
